	\section{Introduction}
	
		Every good paper needs to cite some prior work from IMAC \cite{Downey2021OpenVibrations,Singh2021RealTimeForecasting,Downey2020Millisecondmodelupdating,Downey2016HighCapacityVariable}, but should also reference figures and equations in the text. For example, Figure~\ref{fig:suspension} shows an image of a car suspension that is in the public domain. The displacement of the time can be modeled as a 1-DOF system as shown in equation~\ref{eq:1-DOF}.
		\begin{equation}
		m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = F
		\label{eq:1-DOF}
		\end{equation}
		SEM IMAC does not want indentation for each paragraph. So the \LaTeX template takes care of that. Just make sure to have a space between new paragraphs but do not add spacing between equations you want to be included in a paragraph. 
		
		\begin{figure}
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=2in]{papernum_dow_Fig1.jpg}
			\caption{A public domain picture of car suspension that is designed for vibration control.}
			\label{fig:suspension}
		\end{figure}
		
		This is a new paragraph so there is a space between it and the prior text. Good papers may also have tables, \href{https://www.tablesgenerator.com/}{the website tablesgenerator.com} is a great way to build tables.  
		\begin{table}[]
			\centering
			\caption{Results for a fictional test.}
			\label{table:test}
			\begin{tabular}{@{}lccccccc@{}}
				\toprule
				 & test 1 & test 2 & test 3 & test 4 & test 5 & test 6 & test 7 \\ \midrule
				metric 1 & 0.9 & 0.6 & 0.8 & 0.4 & 0.3 & 0.6 & 0.3 \\
				metric 2 & 1 & 12 & 5 & 32 & 8 & 32 & 2 \\ \bottomrule
